<p>If I could change anything about my favorite language, which at this point is LISP, I would make it easier to implement itâ€™s more powerful features. Mapping functions and
lambda functions are extremely powerful and capable tools, to the point that LISP was the language I was taught to use used when I first attempted an AI class, but their
uniqueness makes it verydifficult for it to be understandable to the average programmer.</p>
